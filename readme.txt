= How to allow users to post pets? =

In order to allow users to post in your site, firstly visit WordPress panel *Settings > General*, check the item *Membership - Anyone can register* and select an user role in *New User Default Role*, to at least `Contributor`.
The Pet Manager autocreate a *Add a pet* page where users can add pets only if the user is logged in, if not, a log in form is displayed. Any pet post submitted by non-editor/admins will be held for moderation.

Note that users will access default register page, but you can use any other plugin to create frontend forms, or even BuddyPress to keep users connect.

= How the contact form works? =

Every pet post can display a contact form (you can turn off this on every post), so visitors can contact the post author. You must use either [Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/) or [SlimJetpack](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/slimjetpack/) in order to use this feature.
Also, to avoid spam, is highly recommended to use [Akismet](http://akismet.com).

= What Add a Pet and Pets pages are for? =

These page are auto generated to provide a place in your site to search and add pets, you can delete these pages if not wanting to use these features.

`add_action( 'wp_print_styles', 'my_deregister_styles', 100 );
